  <h3>"The Greatest Path is the Simplest"</h3>

* This open-source project aims to train a tiny language model called **MiniMind** from scratch in just 3 hours, with a model size of only 26.88M.

* **MiniMind** is extremely lightweight, with the smallest version being approximately $\frac{1}{7000}$ the size of GPT3, making it possible for even an ordinary personal GPU to perform quick inference and even training.

* **MiniMind** provides the full-stage code for a simplified large model structure, dataset cleaning and preprocessing, supervised pretraining, supervised instruction fine-tuning (SFT), low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, and direct preference alignment with reinforcement learning without rewards (DPO). It also includes code for expanding to sparse models with mixed experts (MoE) and multi-modal vision language models (VLM): <a href="https://github.com/jingyaogong/minimind-v">MiniMind-V</a>.

* This is not just an implementation of an open-source model but also a tutorial for getting started with large language models (LLM).

* We hope this project will serve as an introductory example for researchers, helping them quickly get started and inspiring more exploration and innovation in the LLM field.

> To avoid misinterpretation, "fastest 3 hours" means you need a machine with hardware configuration superior to mine. Detailed specifications will be provided below.
