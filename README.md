* This open-source project aims to train a miniature language model **MiniMind** from scratch, with a size of just 26MB.
* **MiniMind** is extremely lightweight, approximately 1/7000 the size of GPT-3, designed to enable fast
  inference and even training on CPUs.
* **MiniMind** is an improvement on the DeepSeek-V2 and Llama3 architectures. The project includes all stages of data
  processing, pretraining, SFT, and DPO, and features a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model.
* This is not only the implementation of an open-source model, but also a tutorial for getting started with large
  language models (LLMs).
* We hope that this project serves as a stepping stone for researchers and developers, providing an introductory example
  to help them quickly get started and foster more exploration and innovation in the LLM field.

  > To avoid any misunderstanding, "fastest 3 hours" refers to the requirement of using hardware with higher
  specifications than the author's setup. Detailed specifications will be provided below.
